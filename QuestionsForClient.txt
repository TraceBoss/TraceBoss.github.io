Should the truck Trailer and driver in Assign just all be drop down lists with the ability to add new ones?

For create what fields shoule auto fill in (Example descripition in shipper does that come from already stored data. If so where do you want the user to enter it.
)?

Where does PO come from cause it was never specified as an input field for Setting Cusomer?

In Settings Shipper and Setting Customers what do you want the NO to be is it just some number I assign in the back end?
